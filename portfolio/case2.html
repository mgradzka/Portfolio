          <h2>Kulia Foodtruck</h2>
          <h4>Role</h4>
          <p>Frontend Developer, UI/UX Designer</p>

          <h4>Tools and technologies</h4>
          <p>JavaScript, CSS, HTML</p>

          <h4>The problem</h4>
          <p>
            Kulià is a new Argentine food truck funded by four friends. The
            foodtruck does not have a website - it is promoted only on social
            media platforms. Kulia is therefore not able to organize its content
            according to its goal and to display information more thoroughly. As
            the foodtruck is located in Nørresundby, outside of the city center,
            it may be difficult for potential cusotmers to learn about this new
            project.
          </p>

          <h4>Solution</h4>
          <p>
            A responsive website providing a comprehensive overview of the
            dishes served at Kulia foodtruck as well as showing it atmosphere
            and vibe.

        <h4>User categorisation</h4>
        <p>
          User categorization is created based on the standard data, to better
          identify the audience.
        </p>
        <img src="/assets/pictures/case-study2-research1.JPG" alt="Case study - research" />
        <p>
          The targeted audience are people living in Northern Jutland, Denmark,
          but also tourists spending their vacation in this area. Mainly in the
          age between mid-twenties to mid-forties. The targeted audience falls
          into specific people categories, such as outgoing people who are
          curious, who are willing to try something new, who are open to enjoy
          an alternative experience and the related environment, or simply
          people who have an interest in fast food due to limited time. Regarding
          the media usage, the targeted audience has access to smart devices
          which can navigate through social media and internet in general.
        </p>
        <h4>Interview guide</h4>
        <p>
          Qualitative interviews are conducted to gather people’s opinion about
          the food trucks and to know their experience with this concept. Also,
          to gather insights about Argentina and its cuisine. The interview
          guide consists of two following research questions, based on the
          client brief and brainstorming: <br /><br />
          <em>Food truck experience</em> <br />
          <em>Opinions about Street food and foreign cuisine</em><br /><br />

          Having the interviews ready, each team member make coding and
          thematizing of the interview to find common patterns.
        </p>

          alt="Case study - research"
        />
        <h4>Empathy maps</h4>
        <p>
          Next step is to create an empathy map, one for each interview. The
          gathered data is sorted into four categories – what the user says,
          thinks, does, and feels. They are filled with quotes and concepts that
          best reflect users’ insights. The data that is most suitable for the
          project is placed there. That kind of visualization help to analyze
          the findings.

          As the project is created with a mobile-first approach, I will show
          case designs based on the mobile version.
        </p>
        <h4>Sketches</h4>
        <p>
          The goal of creating sketches is to give the main impression about
          what is this website is dealing with, what is their concept, and its
          message. Introduce the food truck's uniqueness to the potential
          visitors.

        />

        <h4>Wireframes</h4>
        <p>
          Wireframes are created to structure the ideas. The landing page
          contains the header, menu teaser and event section. This is where
          design patterns are implemented. For instance, card design pattern is
          used to show the menu items, hamburger menu is used for the navigation
          and fat footer design for the footer section. On the menu page, all menu
          items are shown, as well as ingredients and short description about a
          specific dish.
        </p>

        <img src="assets/pictures/case-study2-wireframes2.JPG" alt="Case study - prototyping" />
        <h4>Mockups</h4>
        <p>
          Based on the wireframes more detailed version prototypes can be
          produced. All the iterations are preceded by a user feedback, in order
          to implement their insights. As the colors were already given by the
          client, the main goal at that stage is to create a clear hierarchy and
          to visualize the atmosphere of the place.
        </p>
        <p>
          Concerning the home page, the above the fold content should give the
          user the idea of what the website is about and also reveal some
          information about the place itself. The palm and food truck svgs give
          the place has a loose, friendly vibe. To interact with the website, arrow
          and catchy slogans are added to interest the users.
        </p>
        <p>
          The received feedback suggest that the design is too crowded and
          overwhelming, therefore in the next iteration we give some whitespace
          and prolong the introduction - thanks to that, the design looks more
          clean and the content is more readable. We decide also to limit the
          number of colors.
        </p>
        <p>
          The last feedback before the final iteration shows that the colors are
          not the best match for the website - a dark brown colors reminds more
          of a coffee shop than food truck. Also, the contrast between the brown
          header and white section is too much.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the final version color are more toned down, illustration is
          simplified and shapes less abstract.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <img
          src="/assets/pictures/case-study2-mockup1.JPG"
          class="development"
          alt="Case study - development"
        />
        <p>
          Through the iterations of the menu page, the goal is to display the
          items in most attractive way and ecourage the customers to try them.
          To make the design more playful and fun, svg images are created. We
          have however some problems with diving the items from one another and
          creating a clear visual hierarchy. Eventually we decide to use a card
          design pattern and add some background color to every menu item, which
          makes the information more structured.
        </p>

        <h4>Wordpress and structured data</h4>
        <p>
          Structured data is used in the project to help to dynamically display
          content on the page, such as menu, opening hours and events. Through
          this solution, we want to achieve freedom for the client to have
          control over the content by themselves, and be able to update it when
          needed. For instance, to add new menu items or upload the events they
          plan to participate in. All data are fetched through WordPress, where
          it is structured based on our needs for the website.
        </p>
        <h4>Events</h4>
        <p>
          As the Foodtruck team take part in a lot of events, it is important to
          notify customers about upcoming events. For this reason, advance
          custom field is created in Wordpress.<br />
        </p>
        <img
          src="/assets/pictures/case-study2-wordpress1.jpg"
          class="development"
          alt="Case study - development"
        />
        <p>
          Group for events consists of six field - image, name of a event, a
          date, opening time of the food truck, location and description. This
          group is set for post taxonomy – “kulia-event”. That means whenever
          the client wants to inform the user about the new event, they need to
          create a new post and check mark “kulia-event”, then fill out all the
          needed information.
        </p>
        <img src="/assets/pictures/case-study2-wordpress2.jpg" alt="Case study - development" />
        <p>
          Advanced custom field groups for the menu items and opening hours are
          created following this example. Then the data is tested in WordPress.
        </p>
        <img
          src="/assets/pictures/case-study2-wordpress3.jpg"

        <h4>Mobile first approach and responsiveness</h4>
        <p>
          The realization starts by creating a mark-up in CSS and HTML. In the
          early stage, there are three CSS files. General - for similar
          properties, mobile and desktop. In JavaScript, we create a function
          responsible for rendering the right CSS file, depending on the actual
          screen size. This solution has however many flaws and it cannot be the
          final one. The files are eventually merged, and the code is revisited
          and simplified. The responsiveness is obtained with a help of media
          queries and relative units such as view width and view height. Also,
          with the help of flex and grid.
        </p>
        <h4>JavaScript and fetching data</h4>
        <p>
          One of the main goals of the project is to display dynamic content on
          the frontend. To handle this task, multiple JavaScript are created for
          the designated parts. Main.js file is responsible for covering the
          overlapping functions and event listeners: creating the navigation,
          rendering the map, opening hours, and the main function that calls the
          structured data.
        </p>
        <img
          src="/assets/pictures/case-study2-development-map.JPG"

          class="development"
          alt="Case study - development"
        />
        <p>
          Index.js file is responsible for the elements on the home page: truck
          animation and rendering the event cards. From all the events, only the
          upcoming ones are sorted out And shown on the website in an ascending
          order.
        </p>
        <img
          src="/assets/pictures/case-study2-development2.JPG"
          class="development"
          alt="Case study - development"
        />
        <p>
          DrawEventsCard function is created, where we are looping through the
          events and create a markup for each of them. The function takes two
          parameters - as the first one, we pass only the ascending events, and
          as the second one, the number of card, which can be one or two,
          depending how many upcoming events we have.
        </p>

          alt="Case study - development"
        />
        <p>
          In the menu.js, a function initMenu is created to determine what posts
          have to be fetched. Then, for different elements of the menu
          (sandwiches, drinks, others) a designated markup is created.
