            <h4>The problem</h4>
            <p>
              Foodista.com is a website with a recipe collection as well as
              articles about cooking. It has a really good content, but the
              website is quite old - it is lacking in performance, content
              structure, and visual hierarchy.
            </p>

            <h4>Solution</h4>
            <p>
              A new dynamic website based on a content from Foodista.com, with
              structured data through API.

          <h4>User categorisation & interview guide</h4>
          <p>
            Together with my team we start the project by creating user
            categorization and an interview guide. At this stage our focus is
            to create questions in order to learn about people’s cooking
            preferences and recipe usage. For idea generation and brainstorming
            we use Figma to keep everything in one place. <br />
            <img src="/assets/pictures/case-study3-categorisation.PNG" alt="Case study - research" />
          </p>
          <p>
            In interview guide two research questions are distinguished: <br />
            What is users' attitude towards cooking?<br /><br />
            This research question serves the purpose to gather more insights
            how the users like cooking. Which parts of cooking process are the
            difficult ones, then which are the more pleasant. And what could be
            their motivation to find a recipe for special occasions.
            <br />
            <br />

            What is the motivation behind using recipes? <br />
            This research question serves the purpose to reveal why users use
            recipes. How do they use them in the process of cooking. And what
            could be the key factor in the choice from multiple sources.

          <h4>Sketches</h4>
          <p>
            The process of prototyping consisted of three stages – sketches,
            wireframes and mock-ups – each of them refined by iterations.
          </p>
          <p>
            Drawn sketch starts with a global navigation. This page is intended to
            satisfy the user with information about where they are on the page
            and what information users will find on this page. Call-to-action
            buttons are used to support progressive disclosure and interactivity
            with the page itself. The landing page informs users of two sections
            with the most popular recipes and interesting articles related to
            food.
          </p>
          <img
            src="/assets/pictures/case-study3-sketch1.jpg"
            class="prototyping"
            alt="Case study - prototyping"
          />
          <p>
            This sketch shows what an active section can look like. When users
            are interested in international cuisine, they see lists of recipes
            belonging to this group. This page uses the principle of the
            example. Users can see teaser images of recipes and their names. The
            breadcrumb appears in the upper-left corner to let users know where
            they are on the page. Footer consists of social media bar and
            copyright.
          </p>
          <img
            src="/assets/pictures/case-study3-sketch2.jpg.png"
            class="prototyping"
            alt="Case study - prototyping"
          />

          <h4>Wireframes</h4>
          <p>
            For the landing page, the content of the header is now swapped. The
            page title, paragraphs, and call-to-action button are on the left,
            while the hero image takes place on the right. The header is
            followed by three other sections, with different categories. The
            first one, names "experience something new" is to show random
            recipes from all categories. Next one, "pasta-bilities" is to show
            pasta dishes, as from the user research it turned out that they are
            one of the most popular. The principle of example is used to for the
            headers by showing an image of a specific dish. The informative
            design is also fulfilled by that.
          </p>
          <img
            src="/assets/pictures/case-study3-wireframe1.png"
            class="prototyping"
            alt="Case study - prototyping"
          />
          <p>
            On the category page, sub-navigation is in use to filter all of the
            information, which users can choose from. The main part consists of
            the three cards per row. Each card is represented by an image of the
            dish, a heading for the recipe name and a paragraph for the teaser.
          </p>
          <img
            src="/assets/pictures/case-study3-wireframe2.jpg"
            class="prototyping"
            alt="Case study - prototyping"
          />
          <h4>Mock-ups</h4>
          <p>
            Hero image is used for the home page to catch user’s attention and
            to give them a teaser about the website content. On the left side of
            the hero image heading, paragraph and the button are placed with the
            usage of visual hierarchy rules. The next two sections are designed
            with the usage card pattern – the idea is to display three recipes
            of the two most popular categories (Neil, 2014). The cards – with
            recipes’ image, name and short description – act as the progressive
            disclosure and encourage users to interact by clicking on them. A
            button gives a possibility to visit a page where all recipes of this
            category are displayed.
          </p>
          <img
            src="/assets/pictures/case-study3-mockup1.PNG"
            class="prototyping"
            alt="Case study - prototyping"
          />
          <p>
            Sub navigation is displayed with a help of buttons. Each button
            represents a single category. Whe the category is clicked, the
            content changes accordingly. Similarly to to landing page, each
            recipe teaser is displaye with a usage of deisgn pattern.
          </p>

          <h4>Wordpress and structured data</h4>
          <p>
            The essence of the project is working with structured content and to
            exchange the data through API. For that reason, Wordpress is used to
            store the selected recipes and articles from Foodista website.<br />
            Structured data is used to help to display content dynamically on
            the page. All data are fetched through WordPress, where all the
            data are structured based on our needs for the website.<br />
            To structure the data, we use advanced custom fields. This way we
            create a template for all recipes and articles.
          </p>
          <img
            src="assets/pictures/case-study3-wordpress1.jpg"
            class="development"
            alt="Case study - WordPress"
          /><br />
          <img
            src="assets/pictures/case-study3-wordpress2.jpg"
            class="development"
            alt="Case study - WordPress"
          />
          <p>
            Then, while adding a post, there is an option to choose one of the
            categories we created. Thanks to that, instead of writing the text
            all together in the same place, we get our custom fields.
          </p>
          <img
            src="assets/pictures/case-study3-wordpress3.jpg"
            class="development"
            alt="Case study - WordPress"
          />
          <p>
            Moreover, as there are different types of food, such as
            international food, seasonal, Italian etc., there is a possibility
            to create and add a specific tag with an individual id, which will
            be used to fetch the required recipes.
          </p>

            All the data has a unique number (id) in Wordpress, as well as the

            required recipes for the frontend solution.<br />
            Recipes as called by tags to draw a markup for a recipe teaser.
            Also, the id will be used in the URL to access a single recipe page.
